  This project required me to build a fully responsive landing page to the designs provided. 
  I used HTML5, along with CSS Grid and JavaScript for the areas that required interactivity, 
  such as the testimonial slider.

  Insure

  This was a small project which mostly consisted of HTML and CSS. I built a fully-responsive 
  landing page. The only JavaScript this project required was to enable the toggling of the 
  mobile navigation.

  Fylo

  This project was built in pure HTML and CSS. I had mobile and desktop designs to work to and 
  built it so that it was fully-responsive. I took a mobile-first approach and used modern 
  CSS like Flexbox and Grid for layout purposes.
